Puzzles:

-- How would one implement a set, given search, insert and delete are the frequent queries (CS refresher).

 A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.

 Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.

 To create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary


Sets are created with either set() or {}. Because they work in the same way as mathematical sets, intersection, union, and difference operations work as you would expect:

my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}


-- What happens to x, and why: x = [1, 10, 100]; y = x; y[1] = 20 (Python specifics)

This is called mutability and it is a feature of Python lists to make working with them more natural-feeling

irratetor saves in memory space .... go over the whole data ... fine for small data set but for millions of records its impoosible to bring everything into memory ... just one at a time and ask if their is a next entry .. if not just stop
